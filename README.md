# Node & Express API Creation Introduction

##### The Iron Yard - Week 8, Day 1

For this assignment we were to create an API using Node and Express that would accept a GET, POST, and DELETE request from an Angular application that would interface with the API.

The API was required to store the following user information:
- Id
- Name
- Age
- Whether they liked JavaScript (of course they do, so this is defaulted to checked)

The API was also required to return all data as JSON.

The Angular side of the assignment was to show the user data being stored, and I decided to build a table structure of my own to do this since the data is pretty minimal and confined. We were to also build a form that would allow the user to add new users to our user list. No databases were to be used as of yet.
